## About Project 👋

Just a simple Dashboard type of project taht displayes some cards of information. Here, i focus on react router and practicing component structure. It is not meant to be perfect or finished.

Created using Vite

---

## Features 👨‍💻

- **Navigation:** Allow users to navigate to different pages that show different content using react router

---

## How it works ⚙️

The main premise of the project is that we have some components that are always on the screen, such as Sidebar.jsx and Header.jsx. Using the nav links in the Sidebar, the user can go to different pages but what will actually happen is only the content in the main window will change, Sidebar and Header will always be on the screen. The component taht stores these "always present structure" is Layout.jsx. The rest of the app is jsut dummy content components
